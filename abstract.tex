We seek to lay out the case for the viability of a monopole interferometer to 
 search for the ``global signal" of reionization. We believe this is best 
 understood through the Fourier context of spatial modes, where we can push the 
 low-mode monopole into higher-order modes via spatial windowing. This 
 windowing is managed through the use of absorptive walls around the antennas 
 of the array, which modify each antenna's receptivity of the sky, thus 
 introducing spatial variation into the monopole signal. We can characterize 
 the parameters of these walls and their effects on our observed signal into a 
 set of known sensitivity coefficients, which can then be used to accurately 
 recover the reionization global signal. From our exploration of these 
 parameters, we are able to now state with certainty that we are able to detect 
 the monopole term of the sky using a classical interferometer, and would 
 recommend further investigation into the subject for those seeking to observe 
 and better understand the early history of the Universe.
