We seek to examine the case for the viability of using a classical 
 interferometer to search for the ``global signal" of 21 cm emission from 
 reionization. In particular, we examine how spatial windowing can be used to 
 redistribute a spatial monopole into higher order modes that are accessible to 
 the interferometer. In this study, the windowing is managed through the use of 
 absorptive walls around the individual antennas of the array, which modify 
 each antenna's receptivity of the sky, thus introducing spatial variation into 
 the monopole signal. We can characterize the parameters of these walls and 
 their effects on our observed signal into a set of known sensitivity 
 coefficients, which can then be used to accurately recover the reionization 
 global signal. Preliminary results show that this method does have some 
 sensitivity to the monopole, indicating that it could serve as an alternative 
 experimental design to the traditional single-dish approach, as it benefits 
 from different systematics and finer control of spatial scaling and 
 sensitivity, which may help to mitigate non-isotropic foregrounds.
